        <h1>A group of sentences that are written on separate lines and focus on a single topic. While there is no absolute rule for how many sentences a paragraph should have, some guidelines include</h1><br>
        <h2>
            When necessary, authors should use style sheets to specify the pronunciation of an abbreviated form.
        </h2><br>
        <h3>
            Visual user agents must ensure that the content of the Q element is rendered with delimiting quotation marks. Authors should not put quotation marks at the beginning and end of the content of a Q element.
        </h3><br>
        <h4>
            The HTML markup for defining a paragraph is straightforward: the P element defines a paragraph.
        </h4><br>
        <h5>
            Wrapping the line just before the end tag of the A element causes the comma to be stranded at the beginning of the next line:
        </h5><br>
        <h6>
            Early user agents incorrectly wrapped lines just after the start tag or just before the end tag of an element, which resulted in dangling punctuation. For example, consider this sentence:
        </h6>
