        <p><h1>Fall Home Organizing</h1>
            absolutely love this time of year. Being a Floridian, this is when amazing weather begins for the next several months. This time of year will deliver crisp cold mornings where sweaters and jackets are all that is needed, open windows for a fresh breeze, and the opportunity to take in beautiful views. It’s usually about now that my husband and I look around our home and say how can we upgrade, improve, redo, or reorganize our space. Looking around we wanted to ensure that while the beauty of our home is superb, that behind the scenes the order that it delivered aligns with our lifestyle.</p>
    

 
 
    <p><h1>Celebrate Your Mornings with a Glam Kitchen Nook
    </h1>
    Mornings represent so much – the start of the day, new beginnings, or even a clean slate. Many of us start our day from the same area of our home – the kitchen nook. In fact, more families may eat breakfast together vs. eat dinner together, thanks to this little area. Often times the kitchen nook is part office, part homework station, part breakfast table, part pet food station, part everything. Because of this it can be easy to watch this area look like a tornado came through, and the opportunity to create an organized space is lost
